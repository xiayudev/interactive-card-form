## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS library
- [Vite](https://vite.dev)
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org/) - For Logic

### What I learned
I've learned how to manipulate input element to make values appear on the card. Also, how to validate for blanks and wrong data inserted by the user. Last but not least, how to make a space after 4 number for card number using regular expressions.

### Continued development

I am going to master working with validations forms because i'ts important for web development.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bciaLTTr7s&list=LL&index=1&t=1530s) - This helped me to use regExp to separate numbers after 4 inserted. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G7_VTWnWz40&list=LL&index=2) - This is an amazing video which helped me finally understand how to add data on the card while inserting values on input elements. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
